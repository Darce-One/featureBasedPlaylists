# Feature and Similarity based playlisting
This repository contains code to run through a given directory of mp3 files, analyse features,
present the data, and run an interactive web-app to build playlists based on features and similarity.

## How to install:
Create a python environment, and run `pip install -r requirements.txt`. Code was tested with python-3.11.
Essentia is known to be troublesome to install on linux and windows, sorry about that.
